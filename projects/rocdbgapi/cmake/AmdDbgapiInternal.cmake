# amd-dbgapi-internal: test-only seam target.
#
# The public library (amd-dbgapi) is built with hidden visibility and
# a linker version script that exports only the ~680 public C API
# symbols.  None of the internal C++ classes (process, agent, queue,
# wave, ...) are reachable from outside.  Unit tests need to instantiate
# and probe those classes directly without going through the public
# API, so we build a parallel STATIC archive from the same sources but
# with default visibility and no version script.
#
# This module is included by the top-level CMakeLists.txt when
# AMD_DBGAPI_BUILD_TESTS is ON (or one of the per-tier sub-options).
# It assumes the following variables are already in scope:
#
#   _dbgapi_lib_sources       OS-agnostic source list (set near
#                             add_library(amd-dbgapi ...))
#   _dbgapi_lib_os_sources    OS-specific source list (set in the
#                             Linux/Windows branch)
#
# Anything else (libbacktrace, amd_comgr, generated headers) is picked
# up from the public target's properties so the two targets stay in
# sync without duplicating discovery logic.
