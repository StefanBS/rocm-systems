usage: triage_archive.sh --archive <pid-dir> [options]

Options:
  --archive PATH       pid-* HRR archive directory (required)
  --replay [MODE]      Replay mode: native, docker, auto (default), or bare --replay (= native)
  --no-replay          Metadata / --info only (no GPU replay or preflight block on replay)
  --no-sync            Replay without --sync-after-launch (faster, but a fault is not attributed)

  --format FORMAT      markdown (default) or json
  -h, --help           Show this help

Environment (common):
  HRR_TRIAGE_WORKDIR   Output directory for findings and replay logs
                       (default: $TMPDIR/hrr-triage-<uid>, mode 0700, never the
                       archive; /tmp if TMPDIR is inside the archive, and a
                       mktemp directory if that one is not ours)
  HRR_DOCKER_IMAGE     Docker image for --replay docker / auto
  HRR_DOCKER_MOUNT_CLR=1  Overlay host CLR for docker replay (dev builds)
  GPU                  Replay GPU ordinal (default: auto-pick)
  HRR_REPLAY_TIMEOUT   Seconds before a stalled replay is stopped (default 1800, 0 disables)
