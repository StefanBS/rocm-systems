// Reader for the full-ELF kernel binaries aiecc emits (`aiecc --get-full-elf`).
//
// A full ELF carries the PDI and the control code in one file, along with the relocations that
// say where addresses have to be written into the control code. This reader is used at load time,
// nested inside a unified hsaco's AIE section: the loader parses it, keeps the control code
// pristine in host memory, places the PDI in the agent's device memory, and patches the PDI's
// device address into the pristine copy right away (that address is not known until placement).
// Application argument addresses are not patched here -- at dispatch time, the driver copies the
// pristine control code into a per-dispatch device buffer and patches the argument addresses into
// that copy, so concurrent dispatches of the same kernel never share a patch site.
