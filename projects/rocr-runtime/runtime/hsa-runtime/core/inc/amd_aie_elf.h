// Reader for the full-ELF kernel binaries aiecc emits (`aiecc --get-full-elf`).
//
// A full ELF carries the PDIs and the control code in one file, along with the relocations that
// say where addresses have to be written into the control code. This reader is used at load time,
// nested inside a unified hsaco's AIE section: the loader parses it, keeps the control code
// pristine in host memory and places the PDIs in the agent's device memory. No address is patched
// here -- at dispatch time, the driver copies the pristine control code into a per-dispatch device
// buffer and patches the PDI and argument addresses into that copy, so concurrent dispatches of
// the same kernel never share a patch site.
