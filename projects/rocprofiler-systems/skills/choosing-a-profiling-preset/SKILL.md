name: choosing-a-profiling-preset
description: Recommends which rocprofiler-systems runtime profiling preset (balanced, trace-gpu, trace-hpc, sys-trace, workload-trace, etc.) to pass to `rocprof-sys-run --preset=<name>` or `rocprof-sys-sample --preset=<name>` based on the user's workload and profiling goal, and returns the ready-to-run command. Use when the user asks "which preset should I use", describes a workload (GPU kernel, MPI, OpenMP, AI/ML training, production overview) and wants profiling guidance, or invokes `rocprof-sys-run`/`rocprof-sys-sample` without picking a preset. Do NOT use for CMake build presets (`cmake --preset debug|release|ci`) used to configure/compile rocprofiler-systems itself — that is a build-configuration concern, not a profiling-run concern.

# Choosing a Profiling Preset

Recommends one of rocprofiler-systems' built-in runtime profiling presets for a
described workload, and returns the exact command to run it.

## Prerequisites

None to make the recommendation — this skill only reasons over static preset
metadata. Running the recommended command requires an installed or built
`rocprof-sys-run` / `rocprof-sys-sample` binary.

## Preset reference

| Preset | Category | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `balanced` | general | Recommended default: moderate overhead, profiling+sampling(50Hz)+GPU metrics on, tracing off |
| `profile-only` | general | Lowest overhead flat profile (production, minimal impact) |
| `detailed` | general | Full trace+profile+system metrics, deep bottleneck analysis |
| `trace-gpu` | gpu | GPU device activity + kernel dispatch tracing |
| `trace-hw-counters` | gpu | GPU hardware counters (Occupancy, VALUUtilization) |
| `workload-trace` | gpu | AI/ML training, long-running GPU/HPC workloads (MPI+RCCL+rocPD, 2GB trace buffer) |
| `trace-hpc` | hpc | MPI/OpenMP/Kokkos/RCCL + PAPI counters, compute-intensive HPC apps |
| `trace-openmp` | hpc | OpenMP GPU target-offload apps (kernel/memcpy trace, HSA API excluded) |
| `profile-mpi` | hpc | MPI communication latency only, no GPU metrics or tracing |
| `sys-trace` | tracing | Full system API trace (HIP + HSA + ROCTx + RCCL) for debugging runtime-layer interactions |
| `runtime-trace` | tracing | Runtime API trace only (excludes HSA/compiler-API noise) |

## How to choose

Resolve these in order; the first question that narrows to a single preset wins.

1. **Is this a debugging/troubleshooting question about API interactions**
   (e.g. "why is my HIP call behaving oddly", "what's HSA doing under the
   hood")? → `sys-trace` (full API visibility) or `runtime-trace` (if HSA/
   compiler-level noise should be excluded).

2. **Does the workload have a dominant parallel runtime?**
   - MPI communication latency is the *only* concern, no GPU/tracing needed →
     `profile-mpi`.
   - OpenMP GPU target-offload kernels → `trace-openmp`.
   - Mixed MPI/OpenMP/Kokkos/RCCL, compute-intensive, and hardware counters are
     wanted → `trace-hpc`.
   - AI/ML training or a long-running GPU-accelerated HPC job needing MPI+RCCL
     and durable trace capacity → `workload-trace`.

3. **Is the focus purely the GPU device itself** (not a parallel runtime)?
   - Kernel dispatch / device activity tracing → `trace-gpu`.
   - Specific hardware counters (occupancy, VALU utilization) → `trace-hw-counters`.

4. **Otherwise, general-purpose application profiling** — pick by overhead
   tolerance and depth:
   - Lowest overhead, quick flat profile (e.g. production) → `profile-only`.
   - Balanced tracing+sampling+GPU metrics, good default → `balanced`.
   - Maximum depth, willing to accept high overhead → `detailed`.

If the user's need doesn't fit neatly, default to `balanced` and mention that
domain flags can extend it (see below).

## Output

Return the exact invocation, e.g.:

```bash
rocprof-sys-run --preset=<name> -- ./myapp
# or, for sampling-based profiling:
rocprof-sys-sample --preset=<name> -- ./myapp
```

Mention, if relevant:

- Domain flags (`--gpu`, `--rocm`, `--cpu`, `--parallel`) can layer on top of
  any preset to add/override specific metrics, e.g.
  `rocprof-sys-run --preset=balanced --gpu=temp,power -- ./myapp`.
- `--explain=<name>` and `--list-presets` let the user self-serve verify the
  choice before running.
- `--export-config=<file>.json` freezes the resolved preset+overrides into a
  reusable JSON config — this is the supported way to customize a preset, not
  hand-editing the shipped JSON files.
- Full field-level detail lives in
  `docs/how-to/using-preset-profiles.rst` and
  `source/bin/common/presets/schema.json` — point the user there for anything
  beyond preset selection.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Confusing this with the CMake `--preset debug\|release\|ci` used to *build* rocprofiler-systems | Build presets configure compilation; profiling presets configure a profiling *run*. This skill only covers the latter. |
| Assuming a preset must be customized by editing its JSON file in `source/bin/common/presets/` | Use `--export-config` to produce a customizable copy instead. |
| Picking `detailed` by default for "just get me some data" | Default to `balanced` unless the user explicitly wants maximum depth and can tolerate higher overhead. |
