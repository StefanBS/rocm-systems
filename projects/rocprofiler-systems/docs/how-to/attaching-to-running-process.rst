****************************************************
Attaching to a running process
****************************************************

`ROCm Systems Profiler <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/tree/develop/projects/rocprofiler-systems>`_ can attach
to and profile an already running process using the ``rocprof-sys-attach`` executable.
This capability is useful for profiling long-running applications, daemons, or processes
that are difficult to restart with instrumentation.

Prerequisites
======================

Before starting with process attachment, you should ensure:

* Attachment support is enabled by configuring the ``ROCP_TOOL_ATTACH=1`` environment variable. Without this variable, attachment will fail.

  .. code-block:: shell

     # Start your application with attachment support enabled
     ROCP_TOOL_ATTACH=1 ./my_application

  This is not required if a version of ``rocprofiler-register`` built with ``ROCPROFILER_REGISTER_BUILD_DEFAULT_ATTACHMENT=ON`` is used.

* The target process is compiled with debug symbols or frame pointers for meaningful profiling results.

* The process is running with the appropriate permissions for attachment (see ``ptrace`` requirements).

When to use rocprof-sys-attach
========================================

Use ``rocprof-sys-attach`` when:

* The application is already running and cannot be easily restarted.
* You want to profile a specific phase within a long‑running application.
* The application is started by an external system (For example, job scheduler).
* You need to attach profiling dynamically based on runtime conditions.

The rocprof-sys-attach executable
========================================

View the help menu of ``rocprof-sys-attach`` using the ``-h`` or ``--help`` option:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ rocprof-sys-attach --help
   Usage: rocprof-sys-attach -p <pid>[,<pid>...] [OPTIONS]

   Attach to one or more running processes for profiling.

   Options:
     -p, --pid PID[,PID,...]
                          Process ID(s) to attach to (required, repeatable)
     -o, --output PATH    Output path for profiling results
     -F, --format FORMAT[,FORMAT,...]
                          Output format(s): perfetto, rocpd
     -h, --help           Show this help message

   Environment variables:
     ROCPROFSYS_OUTPUT_PATH       Output directory for profiling data
     ROCPROFSYS_TRACE             Enable perfetto trace output
     ROCPROFSYS_USE_ROCPD         Enable rocpd database output
     ROCPROF_ATTACH_TOOL_LIBRARY  Path to the tool library

   Once attached, enter a session id to detach from that process, 'a' to
   detach from all of them, or ENTER when only one session is left.

Command-line options
----------------------------------------

``-p, --pid PID[,PID,...]`` (required)
   The process ID(s) of the running application(s) to attach to. Multiple PIDs can be
   given as a comma-separated list, by repeating the option, or both. A PID given more
   than once is attached to only once. You can find the PID using tools like ``ps``,
   ``pgrep``, or ``top``.

``-o, --output PATH``
   Specifies the directory for writing the output of the profiling results. If not specified, the
   results are written to the default location (``rocprof-sys-output/``).

``-F, --format FORMAT[,FORMAT,...]``
   Specifies the output format(s) for the profiling data. Multiple formats can be
   provided as a comma-separated list. Available formats are:

   * ``perfetto`` - Generates a Perfetto trace file (``.pftrace``) that can be
     visualized in the `Perfetto UI <https://ui.perfetto.dev>`_.
   * ``rocpd`` - Generates a RocPD SQLite database file (``.db``) for
     programmatic analysis.

Basic usage
========================================

1. Find the process ID of the running application:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ pgrep -f my_application
      12345

2. Attach to the process with basic profiling:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ rocprof-sys-attach -p 12345

3. Wait for the desired profiling period you want to capture, then press ENTER to
   detach and finalize the profiling data.

Examples
========================================

Some examples of process attachment are:

Attach with Perfetto trace output
----------------------------------------

Generate a Perfetto trace file for visualization:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ rocprof-sys-attach -p 12345 -F perfetto

After detaching, the trace file will be available at:
``rocprof-sys-output/<timestamp>/perfetto-trace-12345.pftrace``

Attach with custom output path
----------------------------------------

Specify a custom output directory:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ rocprof-sys-attach -p 12345 -o /path/to/results -F perfetto

Attach with multiple output formats
----------------------------------------

Generate both Perfetto trace and RocPD database:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ rocprof-sys-attach -p 12345 -o ./profiling-results -F perfetto,rocpd

This generates:

* ``./profiling-results/<timestamp>/perfetto-trace-12345.pftrace``
* ``./profiling-results/<timestamp>/rocpd-12345.db``

Using environment variables
----------------------------------------

You can also configure profiling using environment variables:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ROCPROFSYS_OUTPUT_PATH=/my/output ROCPROFSYS_TRACE=true rocprof-sys-attach -p 12345

Workflow example
========================================

Here is a complete workflow for attaching to a running GPU application:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   # Terminal 1: Start your application with attachment support enabled
   $ ROCP_TOOL_ATTACH=1 ./my_gpu_application
   [my_gpu_application] Starting computation...

   # Terminal 2: Find the PID and attach
   $ pgrep -f my_gpu_application
   98765

   $ rocprof-sys-attach -p 98765 -o ./results -F perfetto,rocpd
   [rocprof-sys-attach] Using tool library: /opt/rocm/lib/librocprof-sys-dl.so
   [rocprof-sys-attach] Output path: ./results
   [rocprof-sys-attach] Output format: perfetto rocpd
   [rocprof-sys-attach] Trying to attach to process 98765
   [rocprof-sys-attach] Attached to process 98765. Press ENTER to detach.

   # Let the application run for the profiling period...
   # Press ENTER when ready to stop profiling

   [rocprof-sys-attach] Detached from process 98765
   [rocprof-sys-attach] Output written to: ./results
   [rocprof-sys-attach]   - Perfetto trace: perfetto-trace-98765.pftrace
   [rocprof-sys-attach]   - RocPD database: rocpd-98765.db

   # View the trace in Perfetto UI
   $ firefox https://ui.perfetto.dev
   # Drag and drop the .pftrace file to visualize

Attaching to multiple processes
========================================

A single ``rocprof-sys-attach`` invocation can attach to several independent
processes on the same machine. Each successfully attached process becomes a
session with its own id:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ rocprof-sys-attach -p 101,102,103 -o ./results -F perfetto,rocpd

   Active sessions:
     [1] pid 101
     [2] pid 102
     [3] pid 103
   Enter a session id to detach, or 'a' to detach all:

At the prompt:

* Enter a session id (for example, ``2``) to detach from that process only. The
  other processes stay attached and keep being profiled.
* Enter ``a`` to detach from all remaining processes.
* Press ENTER to detach when only one session is left. With more than one session
  left, ENTER only redisplays the list.
* End of input (for example, ``Ctrl+D``) detaches from all remaining processes.

Each process writes its own output, named after its PID. ``rocprof-sys-attach``
exits once the last session is detached, with a non-zero exit status if attaching
to or detaching from any of the processes failed.

Re-attaching to a process
========================================

After detaching from a process, you can re-attach to the same PID to start a
new profiling session. Each re-attach produces a separate output with its own
timestamp directory.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   # First profiling session
   $ rocprof-sys-attach -p 98765 -o ./results -F perfetto
   [rocprof-sys-attach] Attached to process 98765. Press ENTER to detach.
   # Press ENTER to detach
   [rocprof-sys-attach] Detached from process 98765

   # Second profiling session (same PID)
   $ rocprof-sys-attach -p 98765 -o ./results -F perfetto
   [rocprof-sys-attach] Attached to process 98765. Press ENTER to detach.
   # Press ENTER to detach
   [rocprof-sys-attach] Detached from process 98765

.. note::

   Configuration settings (environment variables, output format, etc.) are
   captured during the first attach and persist across re-attach sessions.
   Changing environment variables between sessions has no effect. To profile
   with different settings, restart the application.

Troubleshooting
========================================

Troubleshooting examples for some common issues are:

Attachment fails immediately
----------------------------------------

If attachment fails, ensure the target process was started with attachment support:

.. code-block:: shell

   # The target process MUST be started with this environment variable
   ROCP_TOOL_ATTACH=1 ./my_application

Without ``ROCP_TOOL_ATTACH=1``, the target process does not initialize the
attachment infrastructure and cannot be profiled dynamically.

Permission denied
-------------------------------

If you receive a permission error when attaching, ensure the following:

1. You have appropriate permissions to attach to the process (same user or root)
2. The ``ptrace`` scope allows attachment:

   .. code-block:: shell

      # Check current setting
      $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

      # Temporarily allow attachment (requires root)
      $ sudo sysctl kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=0

Process not found
----------------------------------------

If the process cannot be found:

1. Verify the PID is correct: ``ps -p <pid>``.
2. Ensure the process is still running.
3. Check if the process is in a different namespace (containers).

Attaching to a process in a container
----------------------------------------

``rocprof-sys-attach`` injects a tool library (``librocprof-sys-dl.so``) into the
target process. The path must be valid in the target's mount namespace (view of
the filesystem), which can differ from the attaching process' when the target runs
in a container. ``rocprof-sys-attach`` picks the library in this order:

1. ``ROCPROF_ATTACH_TOOL_LIBRARY``, if set.
2. The library from its own installation, if the target can see it at the same path.
3. The ``librocprof-sys-dl.so`` shipped with the ROCm installation the target
   process has loaded, found through that process' own view of the filesystem.

If none of these is available in the target's mount namespace, set
``ROCPROF_ATTACH_TOOL_LIBRARY`` to the absolute path of ``librocprof-sys-dl.so``
**as seen by the target process** before attaching:

.. code-block:: shell

   # path of librocprof-sys-dl.so inside the target's own mount namespace
   export ROCPROF_ATTACH_TOOL_LIBRARY=/opt/rocprofiler-systems/lib/librocprof-sys-dl.so
   rocprof-sys-attach -p <pid>

``rocprof-sys-attach`` validates the chosen path against the target's mount
namespace before attaching. If the library cannot be found there, attachment fails
cleanly with a diagnostic instead of injecting a path the target cannot load.
